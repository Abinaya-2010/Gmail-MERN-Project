# Gmail-MERN-Project
A Gmail-style authentication system built with the MERN stack. Users can enter their email on one page and enter the password on the next — just like Gmail’s step-by-step login flow. Built using React Router, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with clean UI and route-based navigation.
